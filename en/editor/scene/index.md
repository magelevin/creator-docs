In this working area, you can select and use the **Transform Tool** to change the *position*, *rotation*, *scale*, *size* and *other attributes of node*, also you will preview the WYSIWYG scene.

## View Introduction

### Navigation

There are some differences between 3D view and 2D view navigation. you can change between 3D view and 2D view by click the 3D/2D button on the toolbar. 3D view is used for 3D scene editing, 2D is used for UI and Sprite editing.

#### 3D View

In 3D view, you can move and rotate the view of the **Scene** panel by the following operations:
- **left mouse button + Alt**: rotate editor camera around view center.
- **middle mouse button**: pan view.
- **mouse scroll**: move editor camera back and forth.
- **right mouse button + WASD**: wandering in scene editor.
- **__F__ shortcut**: focus editor to the selected node.

#### 2D View

In 2D view, you can move and rotate the view of the **Scene** panel by the following operations:
- **middle mouse button**: pan view.
- **mouse scroll**: scale view based on the current mouse position.
- **right mouse button**: pan view.
- **__F__ shortcut**: focus editor to the selected node.

### Coordinate System And Grid

The **Grid** in a scene is an important reference information for us to layout scene elements. For information on relationship between coordinate system and node attributes, like position, please read the [Transform](../../concepts/scene/coord.md) documentation.

### Scene Gizmo

The **Scene Gizmo** is in the upper-right corner of the **Scene** view. It indicates the view direction of editor camera in **Scene** view. You can change view direction quickly by clicking on it.
