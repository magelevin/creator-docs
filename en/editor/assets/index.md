# Assets

The **Assets** panel is an important tool used to access and manage project assets. When starting to make a game, **importing assets** is usually a necessary step. Use the __Hello World__ template project as a starting point when creating a new project. After you create and open a new project, various types of assets are visible in the **Assets** panel.

## Assets Panel introduction

The **Assets** panel is the main panel. It has a **heads-up menu area**, **a central tree list area**, and a **bottom information display area**.

- The functions of the **heads-up menu area** are: **New asset button**, **Sort by button**, **Search type button**, **Search box**, **Fold or expand all button**, and **Refresh list button**.

- The **central tree list area** mainly reflects the hierarchical relationship of assets.
  - The root node is the asset root folder corresponding to the file manager of the operating system. The editor calls an __asset database__ **(DB for short)**, and is located in the project folder. It belongs to the project asset;
  - __Internal DB__ comes with the editor and provides some built-in necessary assets. It is a **read-only** asset. It cannot be **added**, **deleted**, **modified**, but **can** be **directly referenced** or **copied**.

- The __right-click__ menu of the panel is also an important function. The contents of the __right-click__ menu in different locations are different, and the unavailable menus are grayed out.

- The shortcut of the panel currently supports the operation of assets:

  - **Copy**: Ctrl or Cmd + C
  - **Paste**: Ctrl or Cmd + V
  - **Copy**: Ctrl or Cmd + D, Ctrl + drag asset

When adding a asset, an **input box** will appear. The name of the asset is required. If the input is empty, the asset will not be created. If there is no selected item in the tree list, it will be newly created on the root node of `Asset DB` by default; if there are multiple selected items, it will be newly created in the first selected item at this time.

### Selecting Assets

Use the following operations to select assets in the list:

- **Click** to **single-select assets**.
- The **up** and **down** arrows on the keyboard can be used to select.
- Hold down **Ctrl/Cmd + click** to select multiple assets.
- Hold down **Shift + click**to select multiple assets.

### Dragging Resources

Assets can also be added by dragging:

- Move the asset, drag the asset from one folder in the tree list to another folder. At this time, the location box of a target folder will follow the change.
- Drag out assets to the **Scene** panel or **Hierarchy** panel to generate nodes. Currently, `cc.Prefab`, `cc.Mesh`, `cc.SpriteFrame` assets are supported.
- Drag files from **System File Manager** to the list to import assets.
- Drag in the node and drag the node from the **Hierarchy** panel to a folder in the **Assets** panel to save the node as a `cc.Prefab` asset, see the [Prefab](../../asset/prefab.md) documentation.
