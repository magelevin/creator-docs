**ByteDance Mini Games** are developed based on ByteDance full products, which do not require users to download. This is a brand-new game type that can be played on tap.

The game submission, review and release process of a mini-game needs to comply with the requirements and standard processes of the Byte official specification. For specific information, please refer to the links at the end of this document.

## Asset Management for ByteDance Mini Game Environment

In a **ByteDance Mini Game** environment, asset management is the most special part. It differs from the browser in the following four points:

1. The size of the **ByteDance Mini Game** package cannot exceed **4MB**, including all the code and assets. Additional assets must be downloaded via web request.

2. For files downloaded from a remote server, the **ByteDance Mini Game** environment does not have the browser's caching and outdated update mechanism.

3. For the assets in the **ByteDance Mini Game** package, they are not loaded on demand in the mini game environment, but rather all the assets in the package are loaded at once, and then the game page is launched.

4. You cannot download script files from a remote server.

This brings up two key issues, home page loading speed and remote asset caching and version management. For the home page loading speed, we recommend that developers only save the script file in the **ByteDance Mini Game** package, and all other assets are downloaded from the remote server. As for downloading, caching and version management of remote assets, Cocos Creator has done the job for developers.

Specifically, developers need to do the following:

1. When building, enable the **MD5 Cache** in the **Build** config panel.
2. Set the **Remote service address**, and then click **Build**.
3. When the build is complete, upload the **res** folder in the mini game release package to the server.
4. Delete the **res** folder inside the local release package.
5. For the test phase, you may not be able to deploy to the official server, you need to use the local server to test, then open the details page in the WeChat DevTools, check the `Does not verify valid domain names, web-view (business domain names), TLS versions and HTTPS certificates` option in the **Local Settings**.

## Subpackage Loading

The ByteDance Mini Game requires a specific version to support the subpackage feature, and the version requirements for the ByteDance product are as follows:

| Product | Android     | iOS        |
| :--     | :---        | :---       |
| TikTok  | v13.6.0     | v13.7.0    |
| TouTiao | v7.9.9      | v7.9.8     |

For ByteDance DevTools, please use **v2.0.6** or above, but below **v3.0.0**. After updating the DevTools, don't forget to modify the **Debug Base library** to **1.88.0** or above in the ByteDance DevTools.

> **Note**: if the product version does not support subpackage loading, the engine will load the subpackage as a normal asset bundle.

Currently, the size of the ByteDance Mini Game subpackage has following restrictions:
- The size of all subpackages of the entire mini game cannot exceed **16 M**
- The size of a single subpackage/main package cannot exceed **4 M**

For details, please refer to the [ByteDance Subpackage Loading Official Documentation [zh]](https://microapp.bytedance.com/docs/zh-CN/mini-game/develop/framework/subpackages/introduction)
