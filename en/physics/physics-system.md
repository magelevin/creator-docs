# Physics System

The physics system is used to manage all physics related functions. Currently, it is responsible for synchronizing physical elements, triggering physics events and scheduling iterations of the physical world.

## Physics World

When the physics world iterates, physical calculations will be made on physical elements, such as calculating whether each object collides and the force of the object. When the calculation is completed, the physics system will update the physics world to the scene world, so that the game objects will generate corresponding physical behaviors.

> **Note**: there is only a single physical world, and the functional support of the multi-physics world will be discussed later.

## Properties

The properties of the physics system can only be set through the code for the time being. A setting panel will be added in the future, please pay attention to the update announcement.

> **Note**: gets the instance of physics system using: `PhysicsSystem.instance`
