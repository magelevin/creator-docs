# Layer

The `Layer` property of the Node is an unsigned 32-bit integer, supporting up to 32 different types of `Layer`, which can be set in **Project -> Project Settings -> [Layers](../../editor/project/index.md#layers)** in the menu bar above the editor. The developer can customize the Layer **0 ~ 19**, and the remaining 12 Layers are the engine's built-in ones.

The `Visibility` property of the Camera and the `Layer` property of the Node are both used to control the visibility of nodes. However, a node can only be seen by the camera if the `Layer` property set in the node is included in the `Visibility` of the camera. The `Visibility` property of the camera uses bitwise operators (such as `|` and `&`) to determine whether a node's `Layer` should be visible, and supports selecting multiple Layers at the same time. See the [Camera â€” Set the Visibility property](../../editor/components/camera-component.md) documentation for details.
